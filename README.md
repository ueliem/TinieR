#TinieR

This is a front-end for the [Tiny](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tiny_programming_language) language that interfaces with rustVM.

##How to use
Run ```make``` or ```make build``` inside the root of the project. ```make run``` will run the VM with the sample program declared in ```main.rs```. ```make clean``` will clean up the project.
